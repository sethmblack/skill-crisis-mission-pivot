# Crisis Mission Pivot

When circumstances make the original mission impossible, redefine success around what truly matters—people, survival, and core values.

---

## When to Use

- Plans have failed catastrophically and the original goal is now impossible
- Circumstances have changed so dramatically that continuing is foolish
- Team is paralyzed by the loss of the original mission
- User asks "My plan has failed completely" or "How do I pivot in crisis?" or "Everything has changed—what now?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | What failed and why |
| original_mission | Yes | What you were trying to accomplish |
| current_resources | No | What you still have to work with |
| who_affected | Yes | The people involved and their stakes |

## Shackleton's Mission Pivot Framework

Ernest Shackleton faced the ultimate mission failure when the Endurance was crushed by Antarctic ice, ending any hope of crossing the continent. His response became the model for crisis leadership: immediate, clear, and human-centered.

### The Four-Step Pivot

**Step 1: Acknowledge the Loss (Briefly)**
- Name what has happened clearly
- Do not minimize or deny the gravity
- Allow one moment for the team to process
- Keep this brief—dwelling creates paralysis

**Shackleton's Example:** He watched the ship sink, then turned to his men. No extended mourning.

**Step 2: Declare the New Mission**
- State the new objective in simple, concrete terms
- Frame it around what matters most (usually people)
- Make it achievable—not aspirational fantasy
- Connect it to the original values, even if the goal has changed

**Shackleton's Example:** "Ship and stores have gone—so now we'll go home." Nine words. Clear. Achievable. Human-centered.

**Step 3: Communicate with Confidence**
- Project certainty even if you feel none
- Your anxiety is yours alone; their hope depends on you
- Answer the question "What do we do now?" before they ask it
- Eliminate uncertainty about direction, even if outcomes are uncertain

**Shackleton's Example:** The morning after the ship sank, Shackleton and his first mate served tea to the crew—demonstrating normalcy and care, signaling that leadership was functioning.

**Step 4: Create Immediate Action**
- Give everyone something to do TODAY
- Small, concrete tasks restore sense of control
- Busy hands and purposeful work prevent despair
- Establish routine quickly—it becomes the new normal

**Shackleton's Example:** Set up camp, inventory supplies, assign duties. Work started immediately.

## The Pivot Checklist

Before communicating the pivot, answer these questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What is irrevocably lost? | |
| What do we still have? | |
| What matters most now? | |
| What is the simplest statement of our new mission? | |
| What can everyone do today? | |
| What does success look like now? | |

## Common Pivot Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Dangerous | Instead |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Denying the failure | Creates distrust, wastes time | Name what happened clearly |
| Extended mourning | Paralysis spreads | Grieve briefly, then move |
| Vague new mission | Uncertainty creates anxiety | Be concrete and simple |
| Unchanged goals | Chasing the impossible | Redefine success realistically |
| Leader shows despair | Hope collapses | Process privately, project confidence |
| No immediate action | Helplessness takes over | Give everyone something to do |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup just lost our only major customer who represented 80% of revenue. The product was built specifically for them. The team of 12 is in shock. We have 4 months of runway."

**Output:**

## Crisis Mission Pivot

### Acknowledgment
Your ship has been crushed by the ice. 80% of revenue is gone, and with it, the specific future you were building toward. This is a genuine catastrophe, and your team is right to feel the weight of it.

But you are not dead. You have a team, runway, skills, and time to act. Now the question is: what is the new mission?

### The New Mission
**Old Mission:** Build and scale a product for [major customer]
**New Mission:** Keep the team together and find a sustainable path forward within 4 months

**In Shackleton's Words:** "Ship and stores have gone—so now we'll go home."
**Your Version:** "Our customer is gone—so now we build something that doesn't depend on any single customer."

### Communication Strategy
**What to say to the team:**
"I'm not going to pretend this isn't serious. Losing [customer] changes everything. But here's what hasn't changed: this team, our skills, and my commitment to everyone in this room. Our new mission is simple—survive the next four months and find a path that doesn't depend on any one customer. I don't know exactly what that looks like yet, but I know we're going to figure it out together. Here's what we're doing starting today..."

**What NOT to say:**
- "This might be fine" (denial)
- "I don't know what we're going to do" (public despair)
- "Let's take the week to process" (paralysis)

**First visible action:**
Call an all-hands within 24 hours. Be the one who provides clarity, not the one who waits for others to panic.

### Immediate Actions
**Today:**
1. Calculate exact runway with reduced/no revenue
2. List all assets: team skills, IP, customer learnings, code
3. Reach out to your 3 closest advisors for input

**This Week:**
1. Team meeting to align on new mission and immediate priorities
2. Brainstorm: what else could this team/product serve?
3. Customer discovery: who else has problems we can solve?

### What Success Looks Like Now
- Team intact in 4 months
- Clear next product direction identified
- Either: new revenue path, acquisition offer, or graceful wind-down
- No one blindsided—everyone informed and respected

### The Shackleton Reminder
"I thought you would prefer a live donkey to a dead lion."

Saving your team—even if the original mission is lost—is the victory now. A team that survives together can build again. A team that collapses in this moment is lost forever.
